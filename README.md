A simple example demonstrating JavaScript DOM manipulation:
- Event handling with click events
- Changing text content dynamically
- Styling elements through JavaScript
- Basic DOM selection techniques

### 2. Calculator Function (`morning/calculator-function.html`) 
A functional calculator application showcasing:
- JavaScript functions and objects
- DOM manipulation for a user interface
- Event handling for user interactions
- Conditional logic and mathematical operations
- Input validation and error handling

### 3. Todo List Application (`morning/todo-list.html`)
A complete todo list application demonstrating:
- Dynamic DOM manipulation and rendering
- Array operations and data management
- Object-oriented JavaScript patterns
- Event handling for multiple interaction types
- Local state management techniques
- Interactive UI elements with CSS styling
- Task creation, completion tracking, and deletion

### 4. JavaScript Events Reference (`morning/events.js`)
A reference file documenting common JavaScript events:
- Mouse events (click, mousedown, mouseover, etc.)
- Keyboard events (keydown, keyup, keypress)
- Form events (submit, change, focus, blur)
- Document/Window events (load, resize, scroll)
- Event propagation (capturing and bubbling phases)
- Different event listener patterns and implementation techniques

## Afternoon Examples

### 1. Rock Paper Scissors Game (`afternoon/rps.html`)
An interactive game implementation showcasing:

- Dynamic table generation with JavaScript
- Grade calculation algorithms
- Visual feedback with color-coded grades
- Data management for multiple student entries
- Clear and reset functionality

### 3. DOM Events Demo (`afternoon/index.html`)
A simple demonstration of DOM event basics:
- Event bubbling
- Event handling on different elements
- Alert notifications
- Basic DOM selection methods
- Event prevention techniques

### 4. Events Reference (`afternoon/events.js`)
A condensed reference of common JavaScript events and event handling patterns:
- Different syntax for adding event listeners
- Common event types categorized by interaction type
- Quick reference for event-driven programming

## Evening Examples

The evening section contains advanced JavaScript concepts and applications. (Content will be updated as examples are added)

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the morning, afternoon, or evening directory
3. Open any HTML file in a web browser to see the example in action
4. Review the source code to understand how each example works
5. Use the events.js files as references for JavaScript event handling

## Learning Objectives

These examples are designed to demonstrate:
- DOM manipulation techniques for creating dynamic web pages
- Event handling in JavaScript for interactive applications
- Creating responsive and user-friendly web applications
- Practical implementation of JavaScript programming concepts
- UI/UX principles with CSS and JavaScript interaction
- State management and data handling in the browser
- Form processing and validation techniques
- Game development fundamentals with JavaScript

## Development Environment

These examples work best in modern browsers like:
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- Safari

No additional libraries or frameworks are required - all examples use vanilla JavaScript.

Feel free to modify these examples or use them as starting points for your own projects. They're designed to demonstrate core concepts that serve as building blocks for more complex web applications.
